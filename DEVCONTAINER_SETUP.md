# 🚀 Warp Content Processor DevContainer Setup

Your development environment is now fully configured with all the code quality and security scanning tools you prefer! Here's how to get started with the devcontainer.

## ✅ What We've Set Up

### DevContainer Configuration

- **Python 3.11** environment with UV package manager
- **Complete toolchain**: isort, black, ruff, mypy, trunk, pytest, bandit
- **VS Code extensions** for optimal Python development
- **Automated setup script** that configures everything
- **Development scripts** for your preferred workflow

### Key Features

- 🔧 **Auto-fixing**: Scripts that automatically fix formatting and lint issues
- 🔍 **Quality checks**: Comprehensive code quality analysis
- 🛡️ **Security scanning**: Bandit and Safety for vulnerability detection
- 🧪 **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting
- 🌳 **Trunk integration**: Advanced code quality orchestration
- 🪝 **Pre-commit hooks**: Automatic quality checks on commit

## 🚀 Launch Instructions

### Option 1: VS Code (Recommended)

1. **Open project in VS Code**:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

2. **Install Dev Containers extension** (if not already installed):
   - Open Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
   - Search for "Dev Containers"
   - Install the Microsoft Dev Containers extension

3. **Open in Container**:
   - VS Code should show a notification: "Reopen in Container"
   - Click "Reopen in Container"
   - **OR** use Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):
     - Type: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
     - Press Enter

4. **Wait for setup** (5-10 minutes first time):
   - Docker will build the container
   - Setup script will install all dependencies
   - VS Code will configure extensions

### Option 2: Docker CLI

```bash
# Build and run the container
docker build -t warp-content-processor-dev .devcontainer
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace warp-content-processor-dev

# Run setup script
bash .devcontainer/setup.sh
```

## 🎯 Using Your Development Environment

Once the container is running, you'll have access to your preferred workflow tools:

### 🔧 Quick Commands (after setup)

```bash
# Reload shell to get aliases
source ~/.bashrc

# Your preferred workflow
wcp-fix       # Fix formatting (isort, black, ruff --fix)
wcp-test      # Run pytest with coverage
wcp-check     # Quality checks (isort, black, ruff, mypy, trunk)
wcp-security  # Security analysis (bandit, safety)
wcp-ci        # Complete CI workflow
```

### 📋 Step-by-Step Workflow

Following your preferred order: **isort → black → ruff → mypy → trunk → pytest**

```bash
# 1. Fix code formatting and issues
./scripts/fix-code.sh
# This runs: isort, black, ruff --fix, trunk fmt

# 2. Run tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh
# This runs: pytest with coverage

# 3. Check code quality
./scripts/check-quality.sh
# This runs: isort --check, black --check, ruff check, mypy, trunk check

# 4. Security analysis
./scripts/check-security.sh
# This runs: bandit, safety

# 5. Complete CI simulation
./scripts/ci-workflow.sh
# This runs all steps in sequence
```

## 🛠️ Development Features

### VS Code Integration

- **Auto-formatting on save** with Black
- **Import sorting on save** with isort
- **Linting integration** with Ruff and Pylint
- **Type checking** with MyPy
- **Trunk integration** for comprehensive quality checks

### Pre-commit Hooks

Automatically installed and configured to run:

- isort (import sorting)
- black (formatting)
- ruff (linting with auto-fix)
- mypy (type checking)
- bandit (security)
- General quality checks

### Testing Environment

- **pytest** with coverage reporting
- **HTML coverage reports** in `htmlcov/`
- **Parallel test execution** with pytest-xdist
- **Mocking support** with pytest-mock

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start

```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Rebuild container without cache
# In VS Code: Ctrl+Shift+P → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container Without Cache"
```

### Missing Tools After Setup

```bash
# Re-run setup script
bash .devcontainer/setup.sh

# Reload shell aliases
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Permission Issues

```bash
# Fix ownership (run inside container)
sudo chown -R vscode:vscode /workspaces/warp-content-processor
```

### Python Environment Issues

```bash
# Recreate virtual environment
rm -rf .venv
uv venv .venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## 🎉 Ready to Code!

Your development environment now includes:

✅ **Code Quality**: isort, black, ruff, mypy, pylint
✅ **Security**: bandit, safety, trufflehog  
✅ **Testing**: pytest with coverage
✅ **Automation**: trunk, pre-commit hooks
✅ **Convenience**: Development scripts and aliases

### Next Steps:

1. **Launch the devcontainer** using VS Code
2. **Wait for setup to complete** (watch the terminal)
3. **Reload your shell**: `source ~/.bashrc`
4. **Test the workflow**: `wcp-ci`
5. **Start coding** with full quality assurance!

The container provides a complete, isolated development environment that matches your preferred toolchain exactly. All the issues we identified (complex functions, line length, type checking, security) can now be systematically addressed using the automated tools.

Happy coding! 🚀
