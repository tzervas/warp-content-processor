## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Warp Content Processor** is a sophisticated Python application designed to handle robust parsing and processing of mixed, mangled, and contaminated content for Warp Terminal. The current implementation represents a complete, production-ready system with:

### 🎯 Core Features
- **Robust Content Parsing**: Advanced multi-strategy parsing with graceful degradation
- **Content Archaeology**: Intelligent schema extraction from contaminated data sources
- **Security-First Design**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Multi-Format Support**: Workflows, prompts, notebooks, environment variables, and rules
- **Enterprise Quality**: 222 passing tests, zero security vulnerabilities, comprehensive CI/CD

### 📊 Current Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 222 tests passing (100% success rate) in 0.18s
- **Security**: 0 vulnerabilities (perfect security posture via Bandit)
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive formatting and linting (isort, black, ruff, mypy)
- **Performance**: Sub-second execution with efficient resource management
- **Standards**: Full compliance with Python best practices and no-conditionals-in-tests rule

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Content Processing Pipeline
1. **Content Ingestion**: Multi-format file input with security validation
2. **Content Archaeology**: Schema island detection and extraction
3. **Robust Parsing**: Progressive parsing strategies with fallback mechanisms
4. **Content Normalization**: Intelligent cleaning and structure reconstruction
5. **Type Detection**: Advanced content type classification
6. **Output Generation**: Organized, validated output with proper file naming

### Security Model
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive validation of all input content
- **Path Validation**: Secure file path handling with traversal protection
- **Content Scanning**: Pattern-based detection of malicious content
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable timeouts and size restrictions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with security-aware fallbacks

## 🛠️ Development Standards

This project follows strict development standards as documented in the various sections:

- **Python Workflow**: isort → black → ruff → mypy → trunk → pytest
- **Package Management**: UV for dependencies and virtual environment management
- **Testing**: Parametrized tests with no conditional logic (enforced rule)
- **Security**: Continuous security scanning with Bandit
- **Code Quality**: Automated formatting and comprehensive linting
